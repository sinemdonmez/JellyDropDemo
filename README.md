# Tile Matching Game - 2-Day Challenge

Welcome to the **Tile Matching Game** project! This game was built as part of a 2-day development challenge. The objective of the challenge was to create a basic tile-matching game with grid management, tile placement, and basic animations. 

You can view a demo video of the gameplay [here](https://github.com/sinemdonmez/JellyDropDemo/blob/main/Assets/GameVid/jellydropdemo.mp4).

## Features

- **Tile Matching:** The game involves placing tiles in a grid, with matching tiles cleared after being grouped.
- **Tile Types:** Multiple tile types are available, including various shapes like squares and L-shapes.
- **Tile Movement:** Tiles can be dragged and dropped into columns within the grid.
- **Animations:** Tiles drop into place with animations, and matched tiles are cleared with smooth transitions.

## Installation

This project requires **Unity** to run.

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Press "Play" to start the game in Unityâ€™s editor.

## Note on Assets

This project **does not include assets** such as tile sprites, sound effects, or background images. Since it was developed within a two-day challenge, the focus was primarily on the game mechanics and structure. Feel free to add your own assets to bring the game to life!

## How to Play
